Nov 16 implementation notes

- on the submit button to enter name and server address, validate that the fields are
  not empty prior to calling the method in the controller to handle connection to server

- Handshake:
	- Handle errors (state.errorOccured)
	- Send the player's name to the server (with a newline character)
	- Set the ONA to a callback that will handle the next data being sent from the server
		- use a method that processes the message that breaks the message into parts separated
		- separated by a newline character (check the chat client for regex)
		- use TryParse to make sure that the ID and world size are both int values
		- remove the data from the state (does not need a lock)
	- Set the ONA to a callback that will handle the JSON data for drawing the images
		- handle errors
		- JObject parse the message to find which object it is
			
			JObject obj = JObject.parse(//message)
			// etc... 
			// this is in a lecture slide (18 or 19?)

		- deserialize the message
